Contained within an "aside" element, I've structured a compact section encompassing different components:

A "profile" division features an image sourced from "maskot.jpg," with an alternate "error" text. The image's dimensions are set to 100% height and width. Beneath the image, a "Trisha Das" heading ("p1") and a "Pro Member" subheading ("p2") provide identification details.

In the "content" section, there are four divisions ("div1" to "div4"), each encapsulating an icon and associated text:

"auto_read_pause" icon with the label "Stream" in "div1."
"mic_external_on" icon with the label "Games" in "div2."
"stadia_controller" icon with the label "New" in "div3."
"auto_stories" icon with the label "Librery" in "div4."
The "footer" segment concludes the content with a paragraph ("p3") inviting users to "Join pro for free games" and an image linked to "download.png," serving as a visual element.

Incorporating imagery and text, this "aside" section offers a concise snapshot of a user's profile and associated options. The use of icons and labels aids in quick comprehension of available features. Overall, this HTML code creates a visually engaging and informative layout within the context of an "aside" element

The main heading "Active Games" ("h1") serves as the focal point.

A division ("bar1") creates a visual bar element for separating content.

The "hero" section comprises three distinct "card" divisions, each presenting game details:

"card1" displays an image ("gamer.jpg") with an alternate "error" text. Below, "Assassins Creed Valhalla" ("p4") for the PS5 version ("p5") is mentioned. A sub-bar division ("bar2") visually complements the content. Lastly, a "60%" completion label ("percent") concludes the card.
"card2" mirrors the layout of "card1" with the same elements.
"card3" follows the same layout pattern with matching elements.
The arrangement of imagery and text in these "card" divisions conveys active game information and progress percentages. The design is structured and unified, maintaining the aesthetic coherence of the entire layout. This HTML code effectively communicates information about active games through a visually appealing presentation.
